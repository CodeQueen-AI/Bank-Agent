### 🏦 Bank Agent

This project is a **secure Bank Agent system** built using agents and tools to simulate real banking actions 💳 It authenticates users with strict input validation (name, PIN, account number) 🔐 and only allows access to sensitive operations like **checking balance** and **transferring funds** after successful verification. Guardrails are applied at both input and output levels to prevent invalid data and protect sensitive information 🚫 The agent-based design keeps logic clean, safe, and close to real-world banking workflows ✨
